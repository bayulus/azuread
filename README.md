# Hands-On Lab: Implementing Active Directory and Automating User Creation With Powershell

<img src="https://github.com/bayulus/azuread/blob/main/img/azureadlab.png">

<p>In this project, I set up an Active Directory environment and automated user creation using PowerShell. This lab provided a comprehensive, hands-on experience with Active Directory. I covered the installation of Active Directory Domain Services, the creation and configuration of Organizational Units (OUs) and Group Policies, and the automation of user account creation using PowerShell scripts. By the end of this lab, I had a fully functional Active Directory environment and a set of PowerShell scripts to streamline user management tasks.

<h2>Here's A High-Level Outline of The Steps I Took For This Project üß±</h2>

  - **Step 1:** I began by setting up a Windows Server virtual machine, which would serve as the **_domain controller_** housing Active Directory. Then I configured the virtual machine with two network adapters. One adapter connected to the outside internet, while the other was set up for the private network within VirtualBox, using the private IP range 192.168.0.1.
  - **Step 2:** Next, I installed Active Directory on the domain controller and created a domain(orgdomain.com). I ensured that routing was configured correctly so that clients on the private network could access the internet through the domain controller.
  - **Step 3:** To streamline IP address management for the Windows 10 client machines, I set up DHCP on the domain controller. This allowed the client machines to automatically obtain IP addresses from the internal network (192.168.0.X)
  - **Step 4:** After setting up the DHCP, I wrote and executed a PowerShell script to automate the creation of a thousand users in Active Directory.
  - **Step 5:** With Active Directory set up and users created, I proceeded to install Windows 10 as a client machine. I configured it to use the internal network, where it automatically obtained its IP address from the domain controller. This seamless integration allowed the Windows 10 client to authenticate using one of the users created in AD, demonstrating the successful implementation of our Active Directory environment.
